# Trajectory Tracking of Autonomous Vehicle Using PID and MPC Controllers

This repository contains a study of trajectory tracking for an autonomous vehicle using two different controllers: Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) and Model Predictive Control (MPC). The study compares the performance of both controllers in tracking a reference trajectory.

## Overview

In this project, we simulate an autonomous vehicle's path following capabilities using two controllers:
1. **PID Controller** - A simple and classic control approach, tuned to guide the vehicle along a reference path.
2. **MPC Controller** - A more advanced controller that predicts future system behavior, takes into account dynamic constraints, and adjusts the control input accordingly.

## Key Components:
- **Vehicle Model:** A kinematic model of an autonomous vehicle is used to simulate the motion based on control inputs.
- **Reference Path:** The reference trajectory used for testing the controllers is a unit circle for the PID controller and a step input trajectory for the MPC controller.
- **Controller Implementation:** MATLAB/Simulink is used for designing the controllers, simulating the system, and visualizing the results.

## Files Included
- **Car and Reference Images:** Images representing the vehicle and reference trajectory.
- **Driving Scenario:** A driving scenario created using MATLAB's Driving Scenario Design app to generate waypoints, which are then used to calculate reference trajectory position values and yaw angles.
- **MPC Simulink Model Files:**
  - **AutonomousSteeringSystem.slx**: The main Simulink model used for simulating the MPC-based autonomous vehicle steering system.
  - **Meldas_library.slx**: A reference library used to understand and implement Model Predictive Control (MPC), adapted from MathWorks' MPC videos [here](https://www.mathworks.com/videos/series/understanding-model-predictive-control.html).
  - **Params.mat**: The parameter values required for the vehicle and MPC controller, including vehicle model parameters and MPC tuning.

## Instructions for the Simulation

1. **Open the Library:**
   - Open the `Meldas_library.slx` Simulink library to check and modify the MPC configuration.
   
2. **Load Parameters:**
   - Open the `Params.mat` file to load the necessary parameter values into the workspace for the Simulink model.
   
3. **Run the Main Simulation Model:**
   - Open and run the Simulink model `AutonomousSteeringSystem.slx` to start the simulation.

## Simulation Results

### PID Controller Results:
- The vehicle follows a unit circular reference trajectory with minimal deviation.
- The error in x, y, and orientation values is plotted over time.
- The PID controller uses the following gains:
  - Kp: 5.5
  - Ki: 3
  - Kd: 0.5

### MPC Controller Results:
- The MPC controller tracks the reference path (step input trajectory) more accurately.
- Lateral positions and yaw angles are compared between the reference and actual trajectory.

### Comparative Analysis:
- The PID controller shows minor deviations in the tracking error, particularly at the left and right ends of the trajectory.
- The MPC controller provides better accuracy in tracking the reference trajectory, with smaller deviations and more precise handling of dynamic constraints.

## Conclusion
- Both controllers provided satisfactory trajectory tracking, but the MPC controller outperformed the PID controller in terms of accuracy and robustness. 
- The MPC controller effectively accounted for system dynamics and constraints, providing more precise trajectory tracking with minimal error.

## Acknowledgements
- MATLAB documentation and Simulink examples were used to design the control systems.
- This work builds on concepts from classical control theory (PID) and advanced optimization methods (MPC).
- The simulation model replicates the results from the studied paper, using identical vehicle model parameter values.
- The reference trajectory used for the simulation is generated using the waypoints from the driving scenario created in MATLABâ€™s Driving Scenario Design app. The model then uses these waypoints to compute the trajectory's position values and yaw angles.
